# introduction_to_matlab
Just MATLAB intoduction with Examples.

Hello EveryOne,
As you see, this is a project created for Gentle Introduction of MATLAB.
We will try to learn some basics, so we can use it pretty Quickly.

## What is MATLAB?
MATLAB is Numerical computing Environment, a language & an IDE also.
MATLAB is used for Engineering, Scientific Calculations.
By the way MATLAB used in a Huge Range of Applications.
Specifically I use it to Study Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## What We Need?
We need an Environment (i.e. IDE) to run our MATLAB code.
1. MATLAB (OR SCILAB OR Octave)
2. Basic Understanding of programming.


That's it..... We are Ready to Roll !!!

### How to install
You can find a lot of Guides online or on Youtube.<br>
[MATLAB Installation](http://mathworks.com/help/install/standard-installation-procedure.html "MATLAB Installation")<br>
If you Don't want to Pay for it. (Yes ! MATLAB is a Paid..., But when you use it, it's really worth it.)<br>
Use Octave. (All Matlab Syntax also Run in Octave & it's FREE.) <br>
[Octave Installation] (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "GNU Octave")<br>

### How to Run a matlab program
1. Directly on MATLAB command window <br> **OR** <br>
2. Press Ctrl+N For New Script, Type your MATLAB script in it.<br> Save it (Ctrl+S) with .m OR .mat Extension<br>
3. Press F5 to run that Script. (If the option appears Click on 'Add to Path')<br>
